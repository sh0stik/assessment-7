Timing Information:
-------------------
How does each function “scale”? Which of the two functions scales better? How can you tell?
Both functions have O(n) time complexity, but unshift operation requires shifting all existing elements 
to insert a new element at the beginning, which is costly for large arrays in terms of space complexity. 
The push adds a new element at the end of an array, which is generally more efficient as I can see from timing results.
